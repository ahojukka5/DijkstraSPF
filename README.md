# Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

[![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-url]

Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF
algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a
graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by
computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
